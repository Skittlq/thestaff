The Staff is a mod that adds an extremely powerful and very modular tool to Minecraft; King Orange's Staff.
Based on the popular series [Animation vs Minecraft](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7z8SQeih5AdUZvp2JUdYW7WKfF9xa7Rh&si=ZhXCR8zkfpgDF98-) by [Alan Becker](https://www.youtube.com/@alanbecker).

**This mod is currently in alpha, so expect many bugs and unfinished work!**
## Obtaining The Staff
As of now, the only way to obtain the staff is through commands (`/give @s thestaff:purple_staff`) or the creative mode inventory. There will be a way to obtain it in survival in the future.
## Using The Staff
- King Orange's Staff can have a single implemented block inserted into it. 
- To insert a block into the staff, you put the staff in your off-hand, and then hold your target block in your main hand, you then sneak and press right click to insert it into the staff, then you can move it back into your main hand and begin using it. 
- To find what the block's abilities are, you can open your inventory and hover your cursor over the staff to see the list of abilities.
## Implemented Blocks
The Staff accepts the following blocks:
- TNT
- Cake
- Copper Block
- Gold Block
- Iron Block
- Diamond Block
- Netherite Block

More blocks will be added in the future, I plan to add every block's abilities, including some that weren't shown in Alan Becker's animations.
